      <title>AI Training for UAV Pilots</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are building a system that learns what elements determine the quality of a flight and how to discriminate between good and bad maneuvers. This work has a lot of synergies with our other work on teaching UAVs how to fly autonomously through a race course. However, the idea here is to help a novice UAV pilot reach the level of an expert and prevent fatalities by detecting bad maneuvers and correcting mistakes on-the-fly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are using a combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning to teach a UAV to fly autonomously through a race course. The training data is collected using a novel approach by deploying our simulator as a video game and logging flights such that all flights can be regenerated locally. At a later stage this training data will then be complemented with data collected during flights in the real world. Eventually we plan to implement this as a real-world system.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
