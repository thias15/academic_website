We are using a combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning to teach a UAV to fly autonomously through a race course. The training data is collected using a novel approach by deploying our simulator as a video game and logging flights such that all flights can be regenerated locally. At a later stage this training data will then be complemented with data collected during flights in the real world. Eventually we plan to implement this as a real-world system."
