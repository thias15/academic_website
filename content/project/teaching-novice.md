We are building a system that learns what elements determine the quality of a flight and how to discriminate between good and bad maneuvers. This work has a lot of synergies with our other work on teaching UAVs how to fly autonomously through a race course. However, the idea here is to help a novice UAV pilot reach the level of an expert and prevent fatalities by detecting bad maneuvers and correcting mistakes on-the-fly."
