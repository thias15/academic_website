abstract = "​In this paper, we propose a new aerial video dataset and benchmark for low altitude UAV target tracking, as well as, a photorealistic UAV simulator that can be coupled with tracking methods. Our benchmark provides the first evaluation of many state-of-the-art and popular trackers on 123 new and fully annotated HD video sequences captured from a low-altitude aerial perspective. Among the compared trackers, we determine which ones are the most suitable for UAV tracking both in terms of tracking accuracy and run-time. The simulator can be used to evaluate tracking algorithms in real-time scenarios before they are deployed on a UAV in the field, as well as, generate synthetic but photo-realistic tracking datasets with automatic ground truth annotations to easily extend existing real-world datasets. Both the benchmark and simulator are made publicly available to the vision community on our website to further research in the area of object tracking from UAVs."
abstract_short = "In order to evaluate object trackers for aerial tracking applications, we have generated 123 new video sequences from a UAV and annotated them with upright bounding boxes and attributes relevant for tracking. With more than 110,000 frames this is currently the largest data set for aerial tracking by a long shot and the second largest data set for generic tracking. In addition, we have developed a photo-realistic simulator within the UE4 framework that can be used for numerous vision tasks. As an example, we have integrated several state-of-the-art object trackers to control an UAV inside the simulator based on live feedback. In addition our simulator can be used to generate large amounts of realistic vision data."
