      <description>Biography I graduated with a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and Math Minor from Texas A&amp;amp;M University in 2011. After graduation I joined P+Z Engineering in Munich, Germany as an Electrical Engineer and worked for 3 years on the development of mild-hybrid electric machines at BMW. In 2014, I pursued my M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at KAUST and rolled over into the PhD program in 2016. My primary research interest is in object detection and tracking, especially from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.</description>
